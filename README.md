# Metaphor-Analysis-with-distilroberta
This project fine-tunes a **DistilRoBERTa model** for **metaphor detection** inspired by T.S. Eliot's *The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock*. This project uses a small, illustrative dataset designed for metaphor detection and analysis. It contains two types of conversations:

Professorâ€“student dialogue discussing T.S. Eliotâ€™s The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock.
Casual student conversation about the poem.

The dataset demonstrates how the model handles both literary and informal contexts, providing a foundation for training and evaluating metaphor detection with DistilRoBERTa.
It demonstrates how large language models can be adapted for literary and cognitive semantic tasks. ## âœ¨ Features - Uses Hugging Face's distilroberta-base as backbone. - Fine-tuned for **binary sequence classification** (metaphor vs. non-metaphor). - Includes evaluation with **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score**. - Saves trained models for reuse (./models/prufrock_roberta). ## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure - prufrok.convo_Roberta.(metaphor analysis with Roberta).ipynb â€“ main notebook with code. - models/prufrock_roberta/ â€“ directory for saving trained models (auto-created). - data/ â€“ expected dataset location (you can adapt to your own). ## ðŸ›  Requirements Install dependencies:
